## अव्रङ्गज़ेबो हिन्दुकशालानाज़म् आदिशत् #३५२

Observed on day 19 of April (gregorian) month. Julian date was converted to Gregorian in this reckoning. The event has been commemorated since it occurred in 1669 (gregorian era).  
Shortly after the death of Mirza Raja Jai Singh of Amber, a general order was issued (9th April 1669) for the demolition of temples and established schools of the Hindus throughout the empire and banning public worship. Soon after this the great Temple of Keshava Rai was destroyed (Jan.-Feb. 1670) and in its place a lofty mosque was erected. The idols, the author of Maasir-i-Alamgiri informs, were carried to Agra and buried under the steps of the mosque built by Begum Sahiba in order to be continually trodden upon, and the name of Mathura was changed to Islamabad.
