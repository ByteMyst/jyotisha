## अङ्गारकी द्विजप्रिय-महागणपति सङ्कटहर-चतुर्थी-व्रतम्

Special vrata day for Ganesha. In this month, Ganesha is worshipped as dvijapriya-mahāgaṇapatiḥ. Fast during the day and pray to Ganesha after moonrise, as follows:When `caturthI` occurs on a Tuesday, it is known as `aGgArakI` and is even more sacred.
## अङ्गारक-चतुर्थी

chaturthī tithi on a Tuesday is as sacred as a solar eclipse. Good day for doing puja of Ganesha/Subrahmanya with naivedyam of modakam/millet flour respectively.

अमावस्या तु सोमेन सप्तमी भानुना सह।  
चतुर्थी भूमिपुत्रेण सोमपुत्रेण चाष्टमी।  
चतस्रस्तिथयस्त्वेताः सूर्यग्रहणसन्निभाः॥
