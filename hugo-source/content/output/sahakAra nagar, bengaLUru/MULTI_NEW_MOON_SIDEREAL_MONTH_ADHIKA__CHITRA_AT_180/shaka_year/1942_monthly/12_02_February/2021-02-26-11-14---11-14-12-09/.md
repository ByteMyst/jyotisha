## सावर्कर-वीरस्य प्रायोपवेशः #५५

Observed on day 26 of February (gregorian) month. The event has been commemorated since it occurred in 1966 (gregorian era).  
On this day, vIra sAvarkara fasted to death (unlike dramabaazi seen in recent years). Besides inspiring the likes of rAjaguru and madana lAla Dhingra, he worked for hindu recruitment into british military, which proved crucial during the partition.
